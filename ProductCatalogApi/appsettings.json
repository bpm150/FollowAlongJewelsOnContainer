// Every project has appsettings.json file (at the project level)
// In C# past, used to be config files (webconfig, appconfig, etc.)
// But now json instead of XML

// Json javascript object notation
// lightweight key value pair

// We're not really going to be using anything from here.
// We will be moving to docker configurations

// For now, use this appsettings.json config to store ConnectionString
// (to avoid hardcoding it)

// Add ConnectionString as another key

// Value to be actual connection string
// But where do we get it from?
// Not set up docker container yet
// We'll use localdb for the time being

// In VS:
// View > SQL Server Object Explorer
// Shows all of your SQL server instances
// this list is just a client that can look at all of these SQL server
// instances from within VS
// does not mean that you have all of these on your box?
// localdb installed on your machine
// MSSQLLocalDB supposed to be already there

// For early testing, want to write my data into this sql
// server. Right click and Properties (or F4)
// Then copy ConnectionString:

// Data Source=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=master;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=False;ApplicationIntent=ReadWrite;MultiSubnetFailover=False
// and paste after the : in dbl quotes



// Four pieces needed for Connection String:
// Where:             Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB
// Name:              Initial Catalog=CatalogDb < ***IMPORTANT! NOT MASTER!***
// What security:     Integrated Security=True
// When to time out:  Connect Timeout=30


// Connection string tells you: where is the source of your data:
// Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB

// IMPORTANT:
// Need to set a database name, an Initial Catalog,
// that isn't master!
// not going to manually create any of this db
// need the name to programmatically refer to it
// Initial Catalog=CatalogDb
// NO, BAD:
// BAD XX Initial Catalog=master XX BAD
// Do not put your tables in the master database
// This is a really, really bad thing
// Master db keeps track of all tables and dbs in your system

// Integrated security is fine
// this is still a temporary step (on the way to eventually docker)
// Integrated Security=True


// Do need
// Connect Timeout=30
// then delete everything after that from the Connection String

// Now that have ConnectionString defined in config
// Need to feed ConnectionString into my CatalogContext
// when the context is injected
// Who does that? Startup.
